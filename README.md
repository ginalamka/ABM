# ABM

This is my readme.txt



steps:
Set working directory
Set model parameters
Create a for loop for replication (skip this for now)
Initialize population (n=100)
Create a for loop for 50 years (time)
Age the population (start at -1 - 3)
Introduce mortality (density independent and dependent)
Age-related mortality (at age 4)
Make some babies
Output for every year
Pop size
Sex ratio
# newborns
Close loops for time and replication
Summarize parameters/output and put into text file for later
